Udacity introduction to Sql Project
This is the SQL project from the Udacity Programming for Data science Nanodegree. 
I queried the moive dataset and answered 4 business questions:
1. What movies are families watching?
2. Compare the revenue from 2 stores
3. Who are the top 10 customers?
4. How much did the top 10 customers spend in 2007?
